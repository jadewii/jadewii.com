# Music Store Setup Guide

## How to Add Your Music

### 1. Preview Files (For Streaming)
Place low-quality MP3s (128kbps) in `/public/audio/previews/`
- These are for the website player only
- Name them: `track1.mp3`, `track2.mp3`, etc.

### 2. Album Artwork
Place album covers in `/public/images/albums/`
- Recommended size: 500x500px
- Format: JPG or PNG

### 3. Full Quality Downloads (Secure Storage)

#### Option A: Local Development
Create a folder outside the public directory:
```
/music-store-files/
  /albums/
    album1_320.zip
    album1_wav.zip
    album1_flac.zip
  /sample-packs/
    samplepack1.zip
```

#### Option B: Cloud Storage (Recommended for Production)
